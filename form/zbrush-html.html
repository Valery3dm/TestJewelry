            Sculptris is a free sculpting tool, especially suited for creating organic shapes. Users can upgrade to Zbrush, the premium
            digital sculpting tool which allows you to model, paint and texture. Often used for character design, it is also a good tool
            for jewellery modelling due to its high resolution. Zbrush allows you to sculpt anything and add intricate details, such as gemstones.
            It is good for texture and surfaces, however using Zbrush requires some 3D modelling experience.
