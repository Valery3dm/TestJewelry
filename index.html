            <p>Before a 3D printer can start printing your jewellery model, you first need 
                to work on a 3D file and create a 3D model for your jewellery with a 3D design software.</p>
        
            <h1>There is no single software that dominates the market and is the most suitable for everyone.Every designer,
                 whether beginner or experienced, has different needs, preferences, and objectives in mind.
